##Css & HTML:

# I implement media responsive technique for two different width(375px:small mobiles,1024px:Laptop)

# I used form type submit to recieve data

# In aboutme.css I used a template for displayin the project codes(after you hover on about project you will see some pictures with a related link, by clikcing on the link you will refer to related code in github)

##backend:

# I achieved the Stretch goal(creating delete API, Like button)

# All Requirements below are met:

ðŸŽ¯ Create a page containing a form to leave a message and a list of all the messages that have been left.

ðŸŽ¯ Style the form and the messages so they're easy to read on multiple kinds of device.

ðŸŽ¯ Create an API POST route to accept the text from your message input form

ðŸŽ¯ Create a database to store the messages, and create a seed file to create the table

ðŸŽ¯ Create an API GET route to retrieve all the messages from the database

ðŸŽ¯ Fetch the messages from your API in the browser and display them on the page.

# if you check my seed.js , you will se a code for altering the table, that happened because after all tasks i just started to add like column to meet the final Requirement.

# there is a all message button above to show all message

# there is a select option to filter messages using the used emojies

# also there is a input type text, for finding messages that contains the word that you write , after writing the word you shpuld press filter to check result.

# if you press like button you will see the number of likes for 1s

##Future

# I have plan to change security level for deleting messages(if username matches the username of the message , user would be able to delete or edit)

# adding edit button

# adding admin to access all messages
